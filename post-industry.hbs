			<h1>INFOSESSIONS</h1>
			<p>In conjunction with the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, UC Berkeley IEEE also co-hosts several recruiting and publicity Infosessions throughout the year. With typical attendances of over 60 people, our Infosessions are an effective means of reaching the EECS community. We publicize, staff, and acquire food for these events. All you bring is the presentation. Contact us to work out the logistics of holding an Infosession.</p>
